<h1>Make your own</h1>
    <p>We have made the beginnings of a python package which would allow the user to create their own videos</p>
        <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
    
    <p> The python package could be used by a teacher or anyone presenting an image of space. They can create a video by inputting the URL of the image and the right ascension and declination of the object.</p>
    <p> These scripts could also be extended and improved by anyone wanting to develop this further.</p>
    <h3>How to do it</h3>
<p>Create a csv file of the following format:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;">
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>url</td>
<td>ra</td>
<td>dec</td>
<td>text1</td>
<td>text2</td>
<td>text3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Horsehead_Nebula</td>
<td>https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA16008/PIA16008~large.jpg</td>
<td>85.2458</td>
<td>-02.4583</td>
<td> "Hubble Sees a Horsehead of a Different Color"</td>
<td>"Backlit wisps along the Horsehead Nebula upper ridge are being illuminated by Sigma Orionis, a young five-star system just off the top of this image from the Hubble Space Telescope."</td>
<td>"Taken April 19, 2013, Producer JPL, Size 1837x1920px, PIA Number PIA16008"</td>
</tr>

    <ul>
        <li>Much more tidying up on how this works and making it more user friendly.</li>
        <li>Be able to find the right ascension and declination automatically.</li>
        <li>Automatically record the videos.</li>
    </ul>
