This image spans 14,500 light-years.","Triangulum seems to have emerged from the ages having interacted little with other galaxies, maintaining a neat, organized spiral and plenty of material for churning out new stars.","Astronomers will investigate the impact of Triangulum's high star formation rate density as they comb through the huge trove of data gathered by Hubble. These contradictory features — a quiet past coupled to vigorous star formation — make Triangulum a fascinating member of the Local Group, providing key comparisons and contrasts with the Milky Way and our most massive neighbor, Andromeda."

", "These new images are among the largest and sharpest Hubble has ever taken.", "They were made with Hubble's newest camera, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The images are so incredibly sharp, they could be enlarged to billboard size and still retain stunning details."
