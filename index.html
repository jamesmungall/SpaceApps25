<h1>Hubble Sky Viewer</h1>
<p>We have created scripts in python which run on the Gaia Sky application to help visualise the Hubble Space Telescope's high resolution images.
    Our python scripts create a walk though from earth, zooming in on low resolution textures and overlaying them with much higher resolution images
    taken from nasa's Hubble image archive at https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/multimedia/hubble-images/. This gives you a sense of perspective
    as to where these amazing images fit in to the cosmos around us allowing the large image files from Hubble to be fully appreciated. We have included
    the detailed captions provided by Nasa to help give more context for what you are seeing.</p>
