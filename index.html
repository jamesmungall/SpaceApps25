<h1>Hubble Sky Viewer!</h1>
    <img src="HubbleLogo.png" alt="Gaia Space Telescope" width="600">

<p>We have created scripts in Python which run on the Gaia Sky application to help visualise the Hubble Space Telescope's high resolution images.</p>
<p>Our python scripts create a walkthough from earth, zooming in on low resolution textures and overlaying them with much higher resolution images
    taken from <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/multimedia/hubble-images/">NASA's Hubble image archive</a></p><p> This gives you a sense of perspective
    as to where these amazing images fit into the cosmos around us allowing the large image files from Hubble to be fully appreciated. We have included
    the detailed captions provided by NASA to help give more context for what you are seeing.</p>

<h3>What resources have we made?</h3>
    <p> 1. A series of videos</p>
    <p> 2. The beginnings of a python package which would allow the user to create their own videos</p>
