## Hubble Sky Viewer
We have created scripts in Python which run on the Gaia Sky application to help visualise the Hubble Space Telescope's high resolution images.

Our python scripts create a walkthough from earth, zooming in on low resolution textures and overlaying them with much higher resolution images taken from NASA's Hubble image archive.

This gives you a sense of perspective as to where these amazing images fit into the cosmos around us allowing the large image files from Hubble to be fully appreciated. We have included the detailed captions provided by NASA to help give more context for what you are seeing.
